# spectrumSpiral

![alt text](screenshot)

Visualization of the acoustic spectrum mapped to a spiral that makes one turn per octave. This reveals interesting harmonic features in music.

The visualization also includes a cumulative histogram of frequencies binned according to the twelve tone scale.

Includes example audio files.

## Controls

- <kbd>P</kbd> Toggle spiral / stacked octave view
- <kbd>W</kbd>/<kbd>S</kbd> Raise / lower spectrum sensitivity
- <kbd>X</kbd>/<kbd>Z</kbd> Tune twelve tone histogram
- <kbd>L</kbd> Load audio file

Clicking the mouse anywhere between the left and right edges of the window will seek the audio file proportionally.
